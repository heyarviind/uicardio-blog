                    <p>Hugo, as the name definitely doesn't suggest is a known static site generator. Some of you might be knowing what a static site generator is but others are definitely planning to google it. If not, you might just abandon this written piece presuming that you use WordPress and it is best for generation of your sites.</p>
<p><i>We suggest that you go through the article once because there is a paramount chance that you will change your mind.</i></p>

<p>Earlier, we as a company conducted a poll about people’s knowledge about Hugo as a static site generator. Almost 70 percent of people didn’t know what Hugo was.</p>

<p>You all must have seen what a WordPress site looks like but if you want to cast an eye over what a static site generator looks like then you are reading this article in it.</p>
<blockquote>The live example of static site Hugo is our very own site <a href="https://uicard.io/">uicard.io</a> Just leaf through and inspect.</blockquote>

<p><b>Now, let's not beat around the bush, and get straight to the topic.</b></p>

<h2>Standard website making</h2>

<p><h3>Basis process</h3>
 <p>In past and present, there has been a rudimentary process of website building. The weaving of a website involves creating HTML pages, CSS and finally some JavaScript. What you see in the browser are <a href="https://blog.uicard.io/full-form-of-html-is-this-the-question-you-still-ask/">HTML files</a>, hosted back somewhere. It involves a chunk of work in interpretation, sending queries, data in templates and then again forming an HTML document.</p>
<p>With time this huge process has grown and become even larger. The involvement of many steps makes it vulnerable to stars’ number of exploits at every step.</p></p>

<h2>CMS</h2>

<p><i>With this on-going developing process, a new term CMS came into existence.</i></p>

<p>The content management system also is known as CMS is website management system. The availability of ECM and WCM at a single workplace, easy access to data, intuitive indexing, instant content update, no coding required and access to multiple authors are some of the perks that have made CMS most wanted in this game.</p>
<img src="/images/22.jpg/" alt="static site generator" style="height:400px; width:800px" title="amazon ASW to host static site
">

<h3>There are several advantages of using CMS.</h3>
<h4>    Easy and instant update</h4>
<p> The content that you add as the maker of the website, can easily be updated. If you wish to add a new product or article, it is simply done by creating a new article or post It is pretty much a ‘one-click-away’ process.</p>
<h4>Cost of maintenance</h4>
<p> Not everyone in this world is born with a multi-billionaire surname. We all know that normal website building is a hole in the pocket process. This is where CMS enters as a white knight to save us all. As an administrator, you can make changes easily in your panel. Hence, you save money.</p>
 <p>You get the candy and the ice-cream too.</p>
<h4>    Code</h4>
<p>Calling this feature as the cherry on the top would be an injustice. We would like to call it the cake itself. The only reason that whole world is jiggling in CMS is just for this reason.</p>
 <p>If you are not a coder, you can use this.</p>
<h4>Authors</h4>
<p> Suppose you are planning to start a multi-niche blog. You have various niches so want your writers to have the ability to directly access administration panel. CMS gives you that power. You can add as many numbers of authors as you want.</p>

<h2>What world is currently using?</h2>

<p>The answer to this question is not very unfamiliar for developers. WordPress, the term we know as the largest hub for developers and non-developers is a dynamic content management system. Its chronic escalation has taken over the internet so abruptly that the monosyllable CMS is lesser known but <a href="https://wordpress.com/">WordPress</a>, surprisingly is on every countenance. There are other CMS powered site generators like <a href="https://www.drupal.org/">Drupal</a>, <a href="https://www.joomla.org/">Joomla</a>, ExpressionEngine, TextPattern, Silverstripe and MANY more but WordPress has stolen the show.</p>
<p><i>Reasons behind this are already explained above</i></p>
<p><b>And reasons, why you should throw it out of your considerations, are just about to start.</b></p>

<h2>What is a static site generator?</h2>

<p>A static site generator uses source files (the HTML, CSS AND JavaScript files) as input and then converts them into an entire static website. Building a static site, you own a powerful website, server-based but is local on your computer. Websites built with a static site generator are the next big thing in the development world. </p>
<img src="/images/static-files.png/" style="height:500px; width:750px" alt="hugo site">
<p>There is a number of static site generators available online.</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> </li>
    <li><a  href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://hexo.io/">Hexo</a></li>
</ul>
<p>And many more.<p>
<img src="/images/logos.png/" alt="hugo">
<h2>Comparison</h2>
 <p>When it comes to choosing out of these static site generators, we slightly lean towards Hugo. Even when the installation process of both Hugo and Jekyll is same, Hugo has some convenience points over Jekyll</p>
 <ul>
<Li>    Speed</Li>
<p> If we compare static site generators to famous cartoon Ben10, it will be reasonable to term Hugo as Excelerate.It is very fast. This is something that gives it an upper hand over other static site generators. </p>
<i>As Steve Lohr, a technology reporter at the New York Times says </i>
<p>These days, even 400 milliseconds — literally the blink of an eye — is too long</p>
          <b>Speed is a very important factor in today’s competitive world and impatient users.</b>

<li>    Community</li>
<p> In comparison to other generators, Hugo is much more loved and supported. Therefore, if you need any kind of help, it will be easily available online. You may even find people who are ready to guide you through the process.</p>
        

<p><li>    Easy to use</li>
<p> Hugo has a simple one-line command to install it using package managers. If we draw a comparison between Hugo, Jekyll, and Hexo on the basis of ease to install, Hugo would be coined as the winner.</p></p>

<p>While Jekyll is older than Hugo, the later is accelerating its fan following over time. Also, Hugo is becoming number one choice in website making industry.</p>
</ul>

<h2>Why should we use static site generators and ditch WordPress?</h2>

<p>Although <a href="https://blog.uicard.io/difference-between-static-and-dynamic-pages/">dynamic sites</a> are most abundant, they own some serious disadvantages over static sites. These disadvantages are the reason for the popularity of static site generator. Some of the standard advantages of static sites over CMS are-</p>
<h3>Speed</h3>
<p> As already discussed the speed of a website Is every big factor that contributes to its success. A website that takes more time to load has a higher bounce rate than the latter. The entire static site consists of static HTML pages, so web servers are very good at delivering pages. </p>

<p>If we talk about WordPress dynamic sites, they have to go through database queries, templates, and processing. All this hassle slows down the process and as we know users are impatient. Even a second is too long.</p>

<p><h3>    Version control</h3>
<p> Suppose you write an article on your blog and make a minor mistake. You proofread the article but miss that mistake. When you upload the article, one of your users is able to tell you to correct that mistake. But wait, he doesn’t do that publicly.
Yes, that’s how static sites work. </p>
<p>First, you get the control of whole work under one single roof of your Github repo. Your team works collaboratively on files but you get the control to administer who does what and what kind of changes they make.
Second, if there is some mistake in what you did, and if your repository allows, an outside user can post an issue on your Github repository, and you will know that you need a correction.</p></p>

<p><h3>    Security</h3>
<P>This is one of the biggest advantages of a static site generator over WordPress. Their bar of security is extremely high,
quite opposite when comes to dynamic sites.
If we consider WordPress as a honeybee comb, made up of thousand combs. Then hackers will be like enemy bees, that can enter through different vulnerable combs into the hive.<p>
<p>Hackers often find the loops in dynamic sites like outdated WordPress sites, misconfigured databases and plugins. such sites are at a continuous risk of being hacked. </p>
<ul>
    <li>
Hacking of Panama papers was due to an out of date slider plugin</li>
<li>Drupal was also hacked due to same mistakes. </li>
</ul></p>

<p><img src="/images/11.png" style="height:400px; width:500px" alt="static sites"></p>

<p><h3>Cheap</h3>
<p> Static sites are cheap, and by terming cheap we mean pennies. You will possibly be paying just for a server and a domain.
But in a dynamic CMS money flows out wearing tags of setup, hosting, and maintenance.</p></p>

<p><h3>    Less complex</h3>
<p> If you are serious about building your business, then even if you download WordPress, building a theme manually is almost mandatory. Doing so will need you the knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript and additionally PHP, MySQL, and WordPress API.
Comparatively, in a static site, you just need HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p></p>

<p><h3>Support</h3>
<p> Github is like developer’s Facebook. It supports all kinds of static site generators. You can use Github pages for free to host your static site. If still, you need easier and faster assistance to deploy your website, Netlify is always available. It gets all your major work done under one roof like connecting repository, build settings and deploying the website.</p>
