      <description>I was scrolling through where I found a cool number counter, I thought they made it in javascript but after looking at hashtags #3dmax #animation I came to know it was made in 3D software. I was like, why not remake it in javascript (just for fun). After I created the animated counter, I shared it on my Instagram and got very positive reviews and many for the followers were asking for code and tutorials.</description>

      <description>If you are a developer, you will be well aware of the terms static and dynamic pages. On the contrary, let&#39;s assume that you are not a developer and don&#39;t know the explanation. Still, you must know these two words from a normal dictionary. The dynamic word refers to motion.

“I have lived over two-thirds of my life with the threat of death hanging over me. Because every day could be my last, I have developed a desire to make the most of each and every minute” says Stephen Hawking.</description>
