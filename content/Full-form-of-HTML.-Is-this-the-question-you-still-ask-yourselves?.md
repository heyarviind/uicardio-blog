<p>What is full form of HTML? If this is the question that you ask yourself, then there is a fair chance that you lack behind in the time. As much as English is necessary to survive in this competitive world, coding is no far. A fair knowledge of computers and its languages like HTML, CSS and many more is vital for sustainable existence in this fast pacing world.</p>



<p>We are in the hold of the digital world and there is no coming time where you will be free of it so everyone should consider learning HTML on the primary level. Conversely, its clamp over your life and lifestyle will tighten more. There are many instances when you will feel guilty of not owning this skill set.</p>

<p>There are various ways in which knowing HTML will be a blessing for you.</p>

<h3>1.	Making your content easy to read.</h3>

<p> <a href="https://uicard.io/blog/">Blogging</a> is a very important part of every website. If you are an owner of a website and prefer blogging personally, you must have experienced the need to clean the look of the content you showcase. A bulky looking content is of no use. 
Some reasons behind this are</p>

<ul>
	<li>The bulky look is undesirable for anyone’s eye</li>
	<li>It decreases the interest of the user.</li>
	<li>It increases the bounce rate.</li>
	<li>Bulky content is non-preferable when comes under SEO check.</li>
</ul>

<p>Knowing HTML, you will have the complete control of the content you have and the way it looks. Using heading, line-break and image tags the picture looks more alluring.</p>

<h3>2.	Saving cash</h3>
<p>Let’s face the fact, learning HTML is not that big of a deal. It requires a good span of attention and common sense and voilà, you can write your own HTML code. But when your own pot of skill is empty you will need to depend on someone else for your work. HTML developers charge a good lump of money for such work. If negligent, you will be the one to poke the hole in your own pocket.
Besides, there is no lesser intelligent man than the one paying for something that he can do himself.</p>

<h3>3.	A blog post from word into a CMS</h3>
<p>A blog post is written in rough in google docs and word. Editing and proofreading are also done on the same platform, but what is the next step?<br>

<p>Now, when a person writes a piece of content in a word processing document, it is a series of paragraphs woven into an article with the help of headings. But, certain changes are required when we upload the content to website, a dynamic website particularly. After we copy content into CMS, it adds an extra set of snippets. Then these snippets are known to cause problems. To assure smooth flow of content into the blog, you have to get rid of them.
A basic knowledge of HTML can do this for you.</p>

<h3>4.	Anchor tags </h3>
<p>Sometimes while writing an article, it becomes impossible to embed whole deep knowledge of the topic into writing. You may want to link some content to another website or to the earlier posts from your own website.<a href="https://uicard.io/experiments/onboarding-features-tour"> Videos </a>and gifs, which make a blog post even more informative and attractive are a form of anchor tags.  They increase the value of your content and helps in explaining better.</p>

<p>Not just in blogging, but knowing HTML is beneficial in many other ways.</p>
