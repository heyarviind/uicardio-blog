<h2>Need</h2>

Website development is a hectic work. There are different types of websites. These websites represent information or business. The baby step towards this job is to finalize the design of the website. Selecting a design is the first step. With our assistance and as a result of our efforts, you (as users) will have the maximum options on this step.
 
<h2>Our vision</h2>

At the time of establishment of our website, we set the fundamentals of our work on one single vision.

<blockquote>‘Modern developer’s community’</blockquote>

We decided to base all our work on three simple monosyllables.

<blockquote>Modern, easy and effective</blockquote>

Our website, [products](https://uicard.io/products), services, [blog](https://uicard.io/blog) and interaction with customers comes under this. Our every product holds tight to these principles and will continue to hold them in the future.


<h2>Free and premium products</h2>

<p>Our templates, UI kits, and templates are sleek modern and lovable. Bulky websites are
  unwanted. With the growing need for user-friendly designs, simple and effective looks will
  be in demand. Here, we give the developer community with such designs in the form of free
  and premium products. Along with templates, themes and UI kits we will also come up with
  other beautiful components. The developed components like a <a target="_blank" href="https://uicard.io/products/jquery-card-wizard">jQuery Card Wizard</a> are on our product
  list. One Card Wizard already exists, but there are more components to come.</p>


<h2>Components and documentation</h2>

![Example image](/blog/images/components-documentation.jpg)

All the [products](https://uicard.io/products) will have various components which will be clearly defined in code. Also, for a better understanding of products all the templates, themes and especially UI kits will come with proper documentation. We believe that documentation decreases the difficulty faced by customers to the maximum extent.


<h2>Name and logo</h2>

The name [UICard.io](https://uicard.io/) comes from user interface (means by which user and computer interact).
